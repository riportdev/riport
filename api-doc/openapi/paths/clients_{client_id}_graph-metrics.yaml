    List downsampled monitoring data about client metrics for the provided
    clientID
  parameters:
    - name: client_id

      required: true

      in: query
      description: >-
        There is only `timestamp` allowed as sort field. Default direction is
        DESC
         To sort ascending use `&sort=timestamp`.

        type: string

      in: query
      description: >-
        Filter entries by field `timestamp`. `<OPERATOR>` can be one of `gt`,
        `lt`, `since` or `until`.
         `gt` and `lt` require a timestamp value as `unixepoch`. `since` and `until` require a timestamp value in format `RFC3339`.
         e.g. `filter[timestamp][gt]=1636009200&filter[timestamp][lt]=1636009500` or
         e.g. `filter[timestamp][since]=2021-01-01T00:00:00+01:00&filter[timestamp][until]=2021-01-01T01:00:00+01:00`.

         Downsampling data is available for a period `>= 2 hours` and `<= 48 hours`.
         When downsampling takes place you get `avg, min and max` values for `cpu_usage_percent, memory_usage_percent and io_usage_percent`
