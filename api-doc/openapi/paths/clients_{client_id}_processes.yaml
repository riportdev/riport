      description: >-
        There is only `timestamp` allowed as sort field. Default direction is
        DESC
         To sort ascending use `&sort=timestamp`.

        type: string
    - name: filter[timestamp][<OPERATOR>]
      in: query
      description: >-
        Filter entries by field `timestamp`. `<OPERATOR>` can be one of `gt`,
        `lt`, `since` or `until`.
         `gt` and `lt` require a timestamp value as `unixepoch`. `since` and `until` require a timestamp value in format `RFC3339`.
         e.g. `filter[timestamp][gt]=1636009200&filter[timestamp][lt]=1636009500` or
         e.g. `filter[timestamp][since]=2021-01-01T00:00:00+01:00&filter[timestamp][until]=2021-01-01T01:00:00+01:00`.

         Fetching data for a period greater than `48 hours` is not allowed. If the period exceeds `2 hours`, than the returned measurement points get down sampled to reduce the amount of data.
         When down sampling takes place you get `average, min and max` values for `cpu_usage_percent, memory_usage_percent and io_usage_percent`

        Pagination options `page[limit]` and `page[offset]` can be used to get
        more than the first page of results. Default limit is 1 and maximum is
        10.
         The `count` property in meta shows the total number of results.
