    * This API is only enabled if the Rport Plus plugin is loaded and running. For
    more information, see [Rport Plus](https://plus.riport.io/auth/oauth-introduction/).


    * Before this API can be called, the api client must have previously called the
    `/auth/ext/settings/device` endpoint and presented the returned `verification_uri`
    and `user_code` to the user. The user is then responsible for proceeding
    independently to the `verification_uri` page and entering the `user_code` to
    authorize the api client for use with Rport.


    * Once the user is authorized then this API call will return an Rport
    authentication token which will be stored in the `config.json`. The
    user will not need to authenticate again until the Rport token expires.


    * If the user has not authorized yet, then an error will be returned
    indicating that the authorization is `authorization_pending`. The api
    client must wait for the `interval` period (in seconds) after which they
    may try to login again. If the api client retries too quickly then the
    OAuth provider will rate limit the client and a `slow_down` error message
    will be returned.


    * Only the `authorization_pending` and `slow_down` error messages are soft
    errors that can be retried. The api client should abort the authorization
    on receiving any other errors.

    * NOTE: Some OAuth providers return http error status codes while others
    always return 200. If the response is 200, then the api client should
    still check the `error` value in the response for non-empty text. If non-
    empty then there is an error to be handled.
