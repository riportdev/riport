  parameters:
    - name: sort
      in: query
      description: >-
        Sort option `-<field>`(desc) or `<field>`(asc). `<field>` can be one of
        `timestamp, state`.
      schema:
        type: string
    - name: filter
      in: query
      description: >-
        Filter option `filter[<FIELD>]=<VALUE>` or
        `filter[<FIELD>|<FIELD>]=<VALUE>,<VALUE>` for OR conditions, alternatively: 
        `filter[<FIELD>]=or(<VALUE1>,<VALUE2>)` for OR conditions, and `filter[<FIELD>]=and(<VALUE1>,<VALUE2>)` for 
        AND conditions. The `created_at` and `resolved_at` date fields are handled differently, see below.
        
         `<FIELD>` can be one of `state, reference_id, transport, subject, timestamp[gt], timestamp[lt], timestamp[since], timestamp[until]`. 

         You can use `*` wildcards to filter on any field and for partial matches (except the date fields). 
         Text matching is case insensitive, filters can be combined together.<br />

         The `timestamp` fields can be queried with the `gt`, `lt` and `eq` filter
         operators to perform greater than, less than and equal date match filters. The date values specified in the 
         filter must either conform to RFC3339 or be simple date fields (e.g. 2023-07-01). Currently, the other
         fields do not support the `gt`, `lt` and `eq` operators.

      schema:
        type: string
    - name: fields[<RESOURCE>]
      in: query
      description: >-
        Fields to be returned. It should be provided in the format as
        `fields[<RESOURCE>]=<FIELDS>`, where `<RESOURCE>` is `problems` and
        `<FIELDS>` is a comma separated list of fields. Example:
        `fields[clients]=id,name`.
      schema:
        type: string
    - name: page
      in: query
      description: >-
        Pagination options `page[limit]` and `page[offset]` can be used to get
        more than the first page of results. Default limit is 50 and maximum is
        500. The `count` property in meta shows the total number of results.
