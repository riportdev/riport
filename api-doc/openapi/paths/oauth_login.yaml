    * This API is only enabled if the Rport Plus plugin is loaded and running. For
    more information, see [Rport Plus](https://plus.riport.io/auth/oauth-introduction/).


    * It allows an authorization code (`code`) returned by an OAuth provider
    callback to be used to login to RPort and obtain an Rport Authorization JWT
    Token. The `state` parameter also received in the callback must also be
    provided and will be validated by the Rport server.


    * Note that security will be increased if clients verify that the `state`
    parameter returned in the callback matches the `state` parameter supplied
    initially as part of the OAuth `authorize` url. To obtain an `authorize`
    url, the Rport `/auth/ext/settings` endpoint must be called. It will return
    two additional APIs that can be used to perform OAuth based logins.
