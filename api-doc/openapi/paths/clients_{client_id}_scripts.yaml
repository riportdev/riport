  summary: Execute a script by a riport client.
  operationId: ClientScriptsPost
  description: >-
    Rport server will copy script contents to a temp folder on an riport client.
    Then it will implicitly execute shell script as a command e.g. sh
    /tmp/script.sh.
     NOTE: if command limitation is enabled by an riport client then it should allow execution commands like sh script.sh or cmd script.bat or powershell -executionpolicy bypass -file script.ps1.
     See https://oss.riport.io/docs/no06-command-execution.html#securing-your-environment for more details

                 For tacoscript interpreter you should install tacoscript binary from here: https://github.com/riportdev/tacoscript#installation. It should also be available in the system path.
                 Additionally, you can use interpreter aliases or full absolute paths to an interpreter of your choice (see https://oss.riport.io/docs/no14-scripts.html#scripts-execution for details).
